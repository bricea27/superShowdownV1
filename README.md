# Welcome to the ultimate showdown...
## Who would win in a fight? Superman or The Kool-Aid Man?

### Technologies:
This minimal app uses an express backend to hit the http://superheroapi.com API, rendering it a React front end.

### Goal
The goal is pretty simple - display two random fictional characters, with their image and stats, to visually demonstrate who is more "powerful".

### Future Enhancements
Eventually, I plan on implementing some sort of persistent scoring system, such as tallying the winner and only swapping out the loser on "shuffle".
